# The problem MindSpace solves
“Covid -19: India is staring at a mental health crisis”- Hindustan Times

“Covid-19: Rise in mental health issues indicates need to change our priorities” - Times of India

“Mental Illness: A Tale of Rising Cases Amid COVID-19 Pandemic” - www.india.com

As the nation introduces measures to restrict movement as part of efforts to reduce the number of people infected with COVID-19, more and more of us are making huge changes to our daily routines.The new reality of prolonged quarantine period leading to working from home, temporary unemployment, home-schooling of children, and lack of socialisation with other family members, friends and managing the fear of contracting the virus and worry about people close to us who are particularly vulnerable, are all challenging for each one of us. This present environment in the country has increased stress and anxiety amongst the citizens. The recent survey by the Indian Psychiatry Society (IPS) highlights a sudden rise in number of mental patients .What used to be 25 patients daily, has now increased to 100 patients daily in certain mental healthcare clinics!
If ignored (as mental health issues normally are), the post-COVID landscape will be a fertile breeding ground for an increase in chronic stress, anxiety, depression, alcohol dependence, and self-harm.

The solution we present is MindSpace - an app to ensure mental well-being of citizens amidst the pandemic,that promises to keep them positive, stress-free and peaceful using soothing music, meditation podcasts and audiobooks all with the feel of mother Nature’s healing touch in forests, oceans and much more.We also track users’ mood and behavior changes through interactive surveys to which use sentimental analysis through Natural Language Processing to assess their mental health and set appointments with doctors according to severity.

A Nation restarts, only its citizens do. And that begins here, at MindSpace....
